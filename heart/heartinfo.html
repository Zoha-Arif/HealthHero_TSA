    <p>
      The heart is made up of four chambers: right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle. The right atrium receives blood from the veins and pumps it to the right ventricle.
      The right ventricle receives blood from the right atrium and pumps it to the lungs, where it is loaded with oxygen. The left atrium receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the left ventricle.
      The left ventricle pumps oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart has valves. The mitral and tricuspid valves control blood flow from the atria to the ventricles. The aortic and pulmonary valves control blood flow out of the ventricles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The heart has a heart wall. The heart wall is made up of three layers: epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. The epicardium is the outer layer of the heart wall.
      The myocardium is the thick, middle layer of the heart wall. The myocardium contains cardiac muscle tissue. The endocardium is the inner layer of the heart wall.
